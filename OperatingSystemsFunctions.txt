Operation System Functions.
One of the important OS functions is Memory Management. Different programs might need to be executed at one time. OS manages main or primary memory, moves processes between main memory and disk during execution of the programs. Memory management keeps track of memory locations, and processes. 
Another OS function is Device Controlling. All devices on the computer are controlled with the small software programs called device drivers. OS communicates with devices using these device drivers. For example, printers connected to the computer are controlled by  certain printer drivers.
OS is also responsible for Disk Management. It is about how much space and where on the hard disk is allocated for the storage of the files and folders. It is also a utility program where users can view and manage disk drives on the computer.
